First Analysis made for Fun
In the PDF with the Probability Analysis and Diabete-Cholesterol i found some fails
One Mistake is The Probability does not double on having Diabetes with the diagnose having high Cholesterol, because
having Diabetes is roundabout 15%/ 0.15, and having both diseases 0.09 
Now having Cholesterol what are the probabilities to have diabetes diagnosted? = 0.22. 
Mathematically its not a doubled Probability of having diabetes diagnosted, because measured on all surveyed, the probability
of having diabetes was 0.15. I wanted to make this clear. 
It was the First Probability Analysis with R and Vizualisation, mistakes can happen :)
